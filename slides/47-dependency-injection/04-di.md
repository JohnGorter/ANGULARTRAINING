### DI in Angular is used a lot

* Reactive forms: `FormBuilder`
* Backend communication: `HttpClient`, request/response for interceptors
* Routing: `Router`, `ActivatedRoute`, guards
* Change detection: `ChangeDetectorRef`
* Directives: `ElementRef`
* Other libraries: Toastr, Firebase, Highcharts, ...
* Your own services: API services, business objects, ...

---

### The framework

DI in Angular basically consists of three concepts:

* Dependency - The type of which an instance should be created.
* Injector - The injector object that exposes APIs to us to create instances of dependencies.
* Provider - A provider tells the injector how to create an instance of a dependency. A provider takes a token and maps that to a factory function that creates an object.

### What's really going on

Angular has a `StaticInjector` responsible for instantiating objects.

```ts
import { Injector } from '@angular/core';

class Doors { kind = 'doors'; }

class Engine { kind = 'engine'; }

class Car {
  constructor(public doors: Doors, public engine: Engine) {
    console.log(`D: ${doors.kind}, E: ${engine.kind}`);
  }
}

const injector = Injector.create([
  { provide: Doors, deps: [] },
  { provide: Engine, deps: [] },
  { provide: Car, deps: [Doors, Engine] }
]);
const car = injector.get(Car);
```

<!-- .element class="small" -->

---

### Substitute classes

You can also give the injector instructions to substitute a certain class:

```ts
let injector = Injector.create([
  { provide: Engine, useClass: OtherEngine }
]);
```

```ts
let injector = Injector.create([
  { provide: Car, useFactory: () => { /* logic */ return new OtherCar(); } }
]);
```

---

### This injector is associated with a module  

The `providers` array of `@NgModule` is the configuration of the injector

```ts
@NgModule({
	imports: [...],
	declarations: [...],
	providers: [ // here it is!
		CarService,
		{ provide: BookService, useClass: MockBookService }
	],
	bootstrap: [...]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

---

### Components, Directive, Pipe

`@Component`, `@Directive` and `@Pipe` will automatically register for dependency injection


```ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [...],
  declarations: [ // here it is!
    AppComponent,
    CustomPipe,
    MdButton 
  ],
  providers: [...],
  bootstrap: [...]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

---

### One more thing

Every component gets a child injector based on the parent component's injector.

This means that:
* Every provider available in the parent component, will be available in the child component
* A child component can add or alter providers as it sees fit without affecting the parent component.
